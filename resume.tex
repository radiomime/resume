% 	\item Safety nets are more important that guardrails
% 	\item Unit and integration tests are great, but they shouldn't get in the way of development
% 	\item Design safety nets, not only guardrails. Planning for challenges is better than protecting against the possibility of failure
% 	\item Try to use the best tool for the job, but don't get bogged down on perfection
